Chucktor : Actor implementation with golang channels ! 

This is my actor implementation for golang, throughout my journey of mastering akka framework.
I am mostly evolving this little framework with the principles of akka, but adding and removing around.

Once I feel like it has arrived a certain maturity, this read me will certainly change to a short documentation, followed by
a wiki page :)

Why do we use actors when we have channels? Well, because we can ! No, okay mostly, for the sake of code clarity, and business
flow simplicity. I hope I am right :)
